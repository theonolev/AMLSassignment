# AMLSassignment
AMLS mini project assignement on image classification

To execute the code for the AMLS mini project, the following libraries are required:
- shutil
- csv
- numpy
- dlib
- cv2
- skimage
- sklearn
- keras
- matplotlib

The python script 'mini_proj_test.py' must be placed in the same folder as the 'dataset' folder.
The dataset folder must contain:  
  a 'celeba' folder in which there must be the complete 5000 training images dataset,
  a 'testing_dataset' folder in which there must be the complete 100 testing images dataset,
  an 'attribute_list.csv' file giving the labels for each of the 5000 training images.
All three items can be found on the following link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NgP2jQakFHibIhpevDLshodWw-L52yXi

The result csv files for each task are in the 'dataset' folder. If a new script is run and these files are not in this folder, new files will be created.
To avoid the current result to be overwritten, the files have also been copied in the root folder with the python script and the 'dataset'folder.
